# API Conventions

These conventions apply series-wide and are fixed from the first commit.

## Path versioning

Business endpoints live under `/api/v1/`. The health endpoint stays unversioned at `/health`.

## Error envelope

All HTTP errors share one shape, produced by a custom exception handler — never FastAPI's default `{"detail": ...}`:

```json
{
  "error": {
    "code": "not_implemented",
    "message": "Chat API will be implemented in Day 5."
  },
  "correlation_id": "5f0d2c9e-..."
}
```

Endpoints raise `HTTPException` with a `{"code", "message"}` dict as `detail`; the handler in `azgenai_lab.core.errors` wraps it into the envelope.

Validation errors (HTTP 422) currently keep the FastAPI default shape; unifying them into the envelope is planned for the chat API article (Day 5).

## Correlation ID

The middleware in `azgenai_lab.core.correlation`:

- reads `X-Correlation-Id` from the request, or generates a UUID when absent,
- stores it on `request.state.correlation_id`,
- always returns it as the `X-Correlation-Id` response header.

It appears in every error body and, as the series progresses, in structured logs and traces (audit logging and Application Insights articles).

## Placeholder policy

Endpoints that are not implemented yet return an explicit `501 Not Implemented` with the envelope above, rather than fake success.
